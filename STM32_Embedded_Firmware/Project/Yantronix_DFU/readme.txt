Implementation of a device firmware upgrade (DFU) capability in the STM32F10xxx microcontrollers. It follows the DFU class specification defined by the USB Implementers Forum for reprogramming an application through USB-FS-Device. The DFU principle is particularly well suited to USB-FS-Device applications that need to be reprogrammed in the field.
